# Arduino-Glove-Firmware
This code allows the user to send information from analog sensors in an arduino to a computer via Serial.
It is recommended the usage of our driver to send this data to an API.

This code was created for the project Shaking Hands Overseas. We are a group of students in CIC Baxtillerats in Barcelona, who want to move a biomechanical hand without the need of sharing spaces.
